- Not a fan of Kpop/Jpop.

- Huge fans of Melanie Martinez, The Living Thombstone, Lady Gaga

- Tend to get rude while IC so ignores me if you despise that

- (Extreme) apathetic- if I'm being kind/understanding to you, remember it's just an act.

- Regardless of stated above- I still am able to be anyone you want (cheerful/quiet/someone you wish to vent to/rude)

- If you think bullying/harassing/mocking/ignoring me is an ideal opinion- I barely gaf unless you're my close friends.

- Don't care about someone's backstory be it good or not- unless that person acts awful around my friends

- I only stays genuine around my irl cousins (Varen, Charlie, Acocuca etc.)

- Enjoys dark/grim horror or psychology horror, creepypasta, analog horror

- A Russian/English song enthusiast

- If I'm sulking/sensitive, best to ignores me or I'm gonna be a pain to you

- OCCASIONALLY speaks in advance/formal/fancy English just to flex (especially in Safe Indonesia)

- Tend to mention/reply to messages that's supposedly long ago

- Prefers joining the trends once it's no longer popular
